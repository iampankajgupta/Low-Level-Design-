            1. synchronized ensures mutual exclusion (1 thread at a time), but not execution order.
            2. Thread output varies run to run â€” thatâ€™s normal and interviewers want to know if you understand that.
            3. If exact sequencing is needed, then we use wait()/notify(), Semaphore, CountDownLatch, etc.

        * ðŸ¤” Why Synchronize printBalance()? We're just reading, right?
        Yes â€” printBalance() only reads the balance variable. But the key issue is:

        ðŸ”¥ Visibility and Consistency
        Even reading a shared variable from multiple threads (while others are writing to it) can be problematic without synchronization.

        Hereâ€™s why:

        ðŸ§  Java Memory Model (JMM) Rules
        When threads share variables, the Java Memory Model (JMM) says:

        If one thread writes and another thread reads the same variable, and there is no happens-before relationship (like synchronized, volatile, etc.),
        * then the reading thread might see a stale (old) value.

        Thatâ€™s because:

        Threads can cache variables locally (in CPU registers or thread-local caches).

        Without synchronization, there's no guarantee the latest value is visible to other threads.

        âœ… Synchronization = Mutual Exclusion + Memory Visibility
        So when you write this:

        java
        Copy
        Edit
        public synchronized void printBalance() {
            System.out.println(balance);
        }
        *
        *
        It does two things:

        Mutual exclusion (not required for just reading â€” but safe).

        Memory visibility guarantee: Ensures the thread sees the latest committed value of balance.

        Even more safely (but less commonly used), you could mark balance as volatile:

        java
        Copy
        Edit
        private volatile int balance;
        This would ensure read and write visibility, but not atomicity for compound actions like balance += 1000.

        if(balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
