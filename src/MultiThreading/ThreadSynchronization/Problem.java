        * ðŸ§  Why wait() and notify()?
            They help solve thread communication problems â€” e.g., one thread waits for a condition, and another notifies when the condition is true.
            ðŸ”‘ Must-Have Rules:
    ## Must be called from within a synchronized block.
            wait() releases the monitor (lock) and suspends the thread.
            notify() (or notifyAll()) wakes up one (or all) waiting threads.
        *
            * ðŸš¦ Real-Life Scenario: Producer-Consumer
            Letâ€™s say:

            1. Producer puts data into a shared queue.
            2. Consumer waits if queue is empty.
