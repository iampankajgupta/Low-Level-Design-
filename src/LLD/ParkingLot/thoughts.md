Parking Lot

Rules of the System :
Setup:

• The parking lot has multiple slots available for parking.

• Different types of vehicles (bike, car, truck) can occupy different slot sizes.

• Each vehicle is issued a parking ticket upon entry.

• The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration of stay and vehicle type.

Exit and Payment:

• A vehicle needs to make a payment before exiting.

• Multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, UPI) should be supported.

• Once payment is successful, the vehicle is allowed to exit, and the parking slot is freed.

Illegal Actions:

• A vehicle cannot park in an already occupied slot.

• Vehicles cannot vacate without completing the payment process.
