        /*
        * Great question! You're thinking in the right direction by examining your design against **SOLID principles**, especially the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**.

        ---

        ### ‚úÖ First, what does **Interface Segregation Principle** say?

        > **‚ÄúClients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.‚Äù**

        In other words, an interface should have only the methods that are **relevant to the implementing class**.

        ---
        ### üîç Now, let's look at your case:

        You have an interface like this (assumed):

        ```java
        public interface State {
            void insertCoin(int amount);
            void selectProduct(String codeId);
            void dispenseProduct();
            void cancel();
        }
        ```
        And `IdleState` implements **all** of these methods, even though **only `insertCoin` is valid in this state**, and others are just printing ‚ÄúPlease Insert the coin first...‚Äù.

        ---

        ### ‚ùì So, does this violate ISP?

        **Not necessarily.**

        This is actually **typical and acceptable** in a **State design pattern**, because:

        * The purpose of each `State` implementation is to handle all the methods **according to that state‚Äôs behavior**.
        * It‚Äôs **not** that `IdleState` doesn‚Äôt need `selectProduct()` ‚Äî it just behaves differently in `IdleState` than in `HasMoneyState`.

        Each method is still meaningful in every state ‚Äî just handled differently.

        > ‚úÖ So **this does not violate ISP**, because each method is relevant ‚Äî just that its behavior varies by state.

        ---

        ### üß† However, a better question to ask is:

        > ‚ùì *Is my interface bloated with operations that logically belong to separate concerns?*

        In your case, all four operations (`insertCoin`, `selectProduct`, `dispenseProduct`, `cancel`) are directly tied to the lifecycle of a vending machine ‚Äî so bundling them into one `State` interface is reasonable.

        ---
        ### ‚úÖ TL;DR

        * **No**, your implementation **does not violate the Interface Segregation Principle**, because:

          * All methods are relevant to the state, even if they‚Äôre no-ops or warnings.
          * This is expected behavior in the **State Design Pattern**.

        Let me know if you'd like to explore a variation with finer-grained interfaces (though not common in State Pattern unless your context is more complex).
